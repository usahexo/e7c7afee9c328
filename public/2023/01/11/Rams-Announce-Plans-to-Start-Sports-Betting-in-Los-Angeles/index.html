                <h1>Rams Announce Plans to Start Sports Betting in Los Angeles</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Rams-Announce-Plans-to-Start-Sports-Betting-in-Los-Angeles"><a href="#Rams-Announce-Plans-to-Start-Sports-Betting-in-Los-Angeles" class="headerlink" title="Rams Announce Plans to Start Sports Betting in Los Angeles"></a>Rams Announce Plans to Start Sports Betting in Los Angeles</h1><p>The NFL’s Los Angeles Rams made a surprise announcement on Wednesday that they would start offering sports betting in the city starting this season. This is a major shift for the team, which has previously been against gambling on its games.</p>
<p>The Rams plan to partner with a local casino to offer sports betting, with fans able to place bets both at the casino and online. The team did not release any further details about the partnership, such as which casino they would be working with or what types of bets would be available.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise, as the Rams were one of the NFL teams that filed a friend-of-the-court brief opposing New Jersey’s efforts to legalize sports betting. In that brief, the Rams and other teams argued that allowing sports betting would jeopardize the integrity of their games.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the Rams have had a change of heart and are now looking to capitalize on the growing popularity of sports betting in the United States. In a statement released by the team, owner Stan Kroenke said that “the legalization of sports gambling in numerous states across the country has created an environment where our fans are interested in wagering on our games.”</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently legal in Nevada, Delaware, Montana, and Oregon, and is expected to be legalized in additional states this year. In 2017, Americans wagered $4.7 billion on sport bets, and analysts expect that number to grow significantly in coming years.</p>
<h1 id="Rams-Officially-Launch-Sports-Betting-Operation-in-Los-Angeles"><a href="#Rams-Officially-Launch-Sports-Betting-Operation-in-Los-Angeles" class="headerlink" title="Rams Officially Launch Sports Betting Operation in Los Angeles"></a>Rams Officially Launch Sports Betting Operation in Los Angeles</h1><p>The Los Angeles Rams have become the first team in the NFL to launch a sports betting operation, and they did so in style on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Rams officials partnered with William Hill US to open a sportsbook at Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course near Harrisburg, PA. The book has roughly 100 seats and several large-screen TVs.</p>
<p>Rams executive vice president and chief operating officer Kevin Demoff said it was important for the team to get involved in the sports betting landscape early.</p>
<p>“We wanted to be first in market, we wanted to offer fans a great experience,” Demoff said. “It’s something that we think is going to be additive to our fan base and help grow our brand.”</p>
<p>The move comes as no surprise, as NFL teams have been jockeying for position in the burgeoning sports betting industry since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last May. The court’s ruling allowed states to legalize sports betting within their borders, and several have already taken advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<h1 id="Rams’-Sports-Betting-Service-Goes-Live-in-Los-Angeles"><a href="#Rams’-Sports-Betting-Service-Goes-Live-in-Los-Angeles" class="headerlink" title="Rams’ Sports Betting Service Goes Live in Los Angeles"></a>Rams’ Sports Betting Service Goes Live in Los Angeles</h1><p>The Rams’ sports betting service went live on Wednesday, becoming the latest team to offer sports wagering in the city of Los Angeles. The service will be available at all of the Rams’ stadiums, including the new Hollywood Park stadium set to open in 2020.</p>
<p>Fans will be able to place bets on all major sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. In addition to traditional bets, the Rams will also offer a variety of unique betting options, such as prop bets and parlay bets.</p>
<p>The Rams are the fourth team in Los Angeles to offer sports betting services, joining the Lakers, Dodgers, and Clippers. The NFL recently approved a resolution allowing all teams in the league to offer sports betting services.</p>
<p>The Rams’ sports betting service is being offered in partnership with Caesars Entertainment Corporation, one of the largest gaming companies in the world. Caesars is also partnering with other NFL teams, including the Eagles, Bears, Ravens, and Chiefs.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Finally-Arrives-in-Los-Angeles-with-the-Rams"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Finally-Arrives-in-Los-Angeles-with-the-Rams" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Finally Arrives in Los Angeles with the Rams"></a>Sports Betting Finally Arrives in Los Angeles with the Rams</h1><p>For years, Los Angeles has been without a football team. The Rams left in 1994 for St. Louis and the Raiders moved to Oakland in 1995. That all changed in 2016 when the Rams returned to LA.</p>
<p>The city was electric with anticipation for the new season and fans were not disappointed. The Rams were 4-12 in their first season back, but they showed promise and gave fans something to be excited about for the future.</p>
<p>And that future is now. The Rams are coming off an 11-5 season that saw them make it all the way to the Super Bowl. While they ultimately lost to the New England Patriots, the Rams proved that they are a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.</p>
<p>One of the main factors behind their success was their stellar offense led by quarterback Jared Goff. Goff had an MVP-caliber season, throwing for 4,688 yards and 32 touchdowns. He was ably supported by running back Todd Gurley, who ran for 1,873 yards and 17 touchdowns.</p>
<p>The offense will be looking to continue where they left off last season and they should be able to do so with much of the same personnel returning this year. The defense is where there may be some question marks though. They ranked just 22nd in total defense last year and will need to improve if they want to make another deep playoff run.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: LA is a football town now and the Rams are going to have sell out crowds at every game this year. If you’re looking to catch some NFL action while in LA, then head on over to the Coliseum and support your hometown team!</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Rams-Announce-the-Launch-of-their-Sports-Betting-Operation"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Rams-Announce-the-Launch-of-their-Sports-Betting-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Rams Announce the Launch of their Sports Betting Operation"></a>Los Angeles Rams Announce the Launch of their Sports Betting Operation</h1><p>On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Rams became the latest NFL team to enter the sports betting market. The Rams announced the launch of their own sports betting operation, which will include a mobile app and a website.</p>
<p>The Rams’ sports betting operation will be run in partnership with MGM Resorts International. The team did not specify what types of bets would be available, but it is expected that they will offer standard bets such as point spreads, money lines and totals.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have partnered with MGM Resorts International to provide our fans with state-of-the-art sports betting options and to bring our cutting-edge content directly to them,” said Kevin Demoff, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Football Operations for the Rams.</p>
<p>This move by the Rams comes as no surprise, as nearly all NFL teams have announced plans to get into the sports betting market. In May, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had banned sports betting outside of Nevada. This decision opened up the possibility for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, Delaware and West Virginia. Pennsylvania is expected to legalize sports betting in the near future, and other states are likely to follow suit.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the legal sports betting market could be worth as much as $7 billion per year. This presents a huge opportunity for NFL teams and other sporting organizations to partner with gaming companies and establish their own sports betting operations.</p>
<p>In addition to the Rams’ partnership with MGM Resorts International, the Philadelphia Eagles have teamed up with Caesars Entertainment Corporation, while the New England Patriots have partnered with DraftKings. The Oakland Raiders have even filed paperwork to establish their own casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>With so many teams getting into the sports betting market, it is clear that this is an area that is ripe for growth. Sports fans are already accustomed to making wagers on games, so it makes sense for teams to provide them with official platforms where they can do so safely and legally.</p>
