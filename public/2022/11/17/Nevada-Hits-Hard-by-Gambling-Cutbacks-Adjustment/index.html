      		<h1 id="Nevada-Hits-Hard-by-Gambling-Cutbacks-Adjustment"><a href="#Nevada-Hits-Hard-by-Gambling-Cutbacks-Adjustment" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Hits Hard by Gambling Cutbacks Adjustment"></a>Nevada Hits Hard by Gambling Cutbacks Adjustment</h1><p>In the Silver State of Nevada, casino giants are reeling from a proposed Indian gaming bill that would dramatically reduce their cut of gambling revenues. The state currently gets $1 billion in annual revenue sharing from tribes with casinos, but the new legislation would slash that amount by two-thirds. This would be a major hit to the state’s budget, as well as to casino operators such as Wynn Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is sponsored by Republican Representative Mark Amodei and is seen as a reaction to the high levels of poverty on many Indian reservations. “It’s not sustainable when you have people living on dirt roads in houses with no running water and see a casino opening up down the street and all of a sudden they have everything,” said Amodei.</p>
<p>Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval has come out against the measure, arguing that it would cost the state jobs and deprive it of much-needed revenue. Tribal leaders, meanwhile, maintain that the bill is needed to help address chronic poverty on reservations. “This is not about giving us less money,” said Ernie Stevens Jr., chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association. “This is about giving us our fair share.”</p>
<p>The proposed bill marks a significant setback for Nevada’s gambling industry, which has been struggling in recent years amid intensifying competition from other states. In addition to the proposed Indian gaming bill, Nevada faces rising competition from Massachusetts, which recently legalized gambling venues such as casinos and sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Casinos-Battle-for-Survival-as-Gambling-Cutbacks-Kick-In"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Casinos-Battle-for-Survival-as-Gambling-Cutbacks-Kick-In" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Casinos Battle for Survival as Gambling Cutbacks Kick In"></a>Atlantic City Casinos Battle for Survival as Gambling Cutbacks Kick In</h1><p>Atlantic City is known as a gambling mecca, but recent cutbacks in gambling revenue are making things tough for the city’s casinos.</p>
<p>The Trump Taj Mahal casino is the latest to announce layoffs, with 400 employees set to be let go. The Atlantic Club and Showboat casinos have already closed, and the Revel casino is up for sale.</p>
<p>Revenue from gambling has been declining for years as neighboring states have opened up their own casinos. Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware, and Maryland all have casinos within driving distance of Atlantic City, taking away business from the Atlantic City casinos.</p>
<p>Atlantic City officials are hoping to turn things around by expanding the convention center and developing new tourism attractions. But it may be too little, too late, as the city’s casino industry continues to struggle.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-Casinos-Brace-for-Impact-of-Gambling-Cutbacks"><a href="#Missouri-Casinos-Brace-for-Impact-of-Gambling-Cutbacks" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Casinos Brace for Impact of Gambling Cutbacks"></a>Missouri Casinos Brace for Impact of Gambling Cutbacks</h1><p>Missouri’s budget woes will soon impact casino operators in the state. Governor Eric Greitens recently signed a bill that cuts gambling revenue by $180 million per year. The measure is aimed at closing a $500 million budget gap.</p>
<p>Casino operators are already preparing for the impact of the gambling cutbacks. Ameristar Casino Resort Spa in St. Charles recently announced it will reduce its workforce by 150 positions. The company said it will also reduce its promotional spending and capital expenditures.</p>
<p>The gaming industry in Missouri is worth an estimated $2 billion per year. Casino operators have warned that the budget cuts could lead to widespread job losses and reduced tax revenue for the state.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-Gaming-Operators-Struggle-After-Gambling-Cutbacks"><a href="#Indian-Gaming-Operators-Struggle-After-Gambling-Cutbacks" class="headerlink" title="Indian Gaming Operators Struggle After Gambling Cutbacks"></a>Indian Gaming Operators Struggle After Gambling Cutbacks</h1><p>Since the early 2000s, when Indian gaming first boomed in the U.S., tribes across the country have increasingly come to rely on casino profits for government services and other essential needs. But now, as gambling revenue declines nationwide, tribes are struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p>In California, for example, casino revenue has plunged by about a third over the past five years. That’s left some tribes here – which benefit from the state’s expansive gambling industry – facing million-dollar budget shortfalls and cuts in essential services.</p>
<p>The Paragon Casino Resort in Marksville, Louisiana is another example of a gaming operation struggling to stay afloat. The tribe there recently announced it will lay off nearly 60 percent of its staff due to declining revenue.</p>
<p>Nationwide, commercial casinos brought in $38.3 billion in revenue in 2017, down from a high of $41.5 billion in 2007, according to data from the American Gaming Association (AGA). Slots and table games accounted for $26.5 billion of that total last year, down from a high of $29.6 billion in 2007.</p>
<p>Declining revenue has led many tribes to reduce expenses and tighten their belts. Others are looking for ways to diversify their businesses and generate new sources of income. Many are also pressing state and federal officials for help through legislative lobbying or legal challenges seeking more favorable terms for casino operations.</p>
<p>Some tribal advocates argue that Indian gaming still provides an important economic boost to many reservations and should not be scapegoated for larger financial problems within tribal economies. They note that many tribes have used casino profits to fund education, health care and other critical services that might not otherwise be available on reservations.</p>
<p>Gaming opponents say the industry has become too reliant on gambling and has caused social ills such as addiction, bankruptcy and crime rates. They argue that tribes should focus on developing other forms of economic activity instead of relying on casinos to provide jobs and government services</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-the-Future-Hold-for-Gambling-in-America"><a href="#What-Does-the-Future-Hold-for-Gambling-in-America" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Future Hold for Gambling in America?"></a>What Does the Future Hold for Gambling in America?</h1><p>The gambling industry in America is booming, and there’s no sign that it’s going to slow down any time soon. In this article, we take a look at what the future holds for gambling in America.</p>
<p>We’ll start by looking at the current state of gambling in America. According to a recent study by the American Gaming Association (AGA), gambling revenues reached a record high of $240.4 billion in 2017. This represents a 3.2% increase from 2016, and it’s clear that the gambling industry is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>So what’s driving this growth? There are several factors at play here. Firstly, online gambling is becoming increasingly popular. In 2017, online gambling revenues totaled $11.5 billion, up 20% from the previous year. This growth is being driven by the expanding availability of online casinos and the increasing popularity of mobile gaming.</p>
<p>Another factor driving growth is the legalization of new forms of gambling. In recent years, several states have legalized sports betting, and this is expected to drive further growth in the coming years. States such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania are expected to see significant increases in gambling revenues in the coming years as a result of this development.</p>
<p>So what does the future hold for gambling in America? The industry is clearly growing rapidly, and there’s no reason to believe that this growth will slow down anytime soon. Online gambling is expanding rapidly, and new forms of gambling are being legalized every year. This looks like it’s going to be a very exciting time for the gambling industry!</p>
