The aim of the game is to score points by taking as many tricks as possible. The player who takes the most tricks wins the game.</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt six cards, and the rest of the cards are placed face down in the middle of the players to create a stockpile. The top card of the stockpile is turned over to become the first trump card. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by playing any card from their hand.</p>
<p>The player who plays the highest trump card during that trick wins it, and they then collect all of the other cards played during that trick and place them into a face-down pile in front of them. If a trump card is not played, then the highest card of the suit played wins it instead and that player collects all of the other cards played during that trick and places them into aface-down pile in front of them.</p>
<p>When all six cards have been played, each player picks up another card fromthe stockpile to bring their total back up to six. The next round then begins withthe person who won the last trick. The winner isthe first player to run out of cards. They then count up allof their collected tricks and score one point for each one. Theplayer withthe most tricks at endgame wins!</p>

<h1 id="What-is-the-significance-of-the-Princess-Royal"><a href="#What-is-the-significance-of-the-Princess-Royal" class="headerlink" title="What is the significance of the Princess Royal?"></a>What is the significance of the Princess Royal?</h1><p>The Princess Royal is the eldest daughter of the reigning British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. She was born on 21st August 1950 and is thus currently aged 67. Many people are unaware of the significance of this title, awarded to her in 1987. Here we will discuss some of the key points about this very special lady.</p>
<p>Firstly, as the eldest daughter of the Queen, she is automatically entitled to various privileges and roles. These include being appointed Regent in the event that her mother cannot reign, and taking on a role in the government if required. The Princess Royal also serves as a Counsellor of State, meaning she can attend cabinet meetings and offer advice on issues relating to the monarchy when needed.</p>
<p>Additionally, as Princess Royal she carries out a large number of public engagements on behalf of her mother and country. She represents British interests around the world and promotes charitable causes close to her heart. In fact, she is one of the most highly active members of the royal family when it comes to charitable work.</p>
<p>Finally, due to her rank and status, The Princess Royal is often seen as an ambassador for Britain. She is well-respected both domestically and abroad for her many achievements, making her an important figure in modern society. We hope this article has helped to shine a light on why The Princess Royal is such an important member of our royal family.</p>
