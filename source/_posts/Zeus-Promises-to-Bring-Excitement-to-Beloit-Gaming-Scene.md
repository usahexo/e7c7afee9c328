#  Zeus Promises to Bring Excitement to Beloit Gaming Scene

Beloit, Wisconsin - Zeus, a new gaming and entertainment venue, is scheduled to open in downtown Beloit this summer. With 12,000 square feet of space, the venue will offer a variety of activities including laser tag, an arcade, and a mini golf course.

"We're really excited to bring Zeus to Beloit," said owner Justin Kapp. "This is going to be a great place for families and friends to come and have some fun."

Zeus is also promising to add excitement to the area's gaming scene. The venue will offer a wide variety of games including popular titles such as Fortnite, Madden NFL 19, and NBA 2K19.

"There's already a lot of great gaming options in the area," said Kapp. "But Zeus will be the only place you can go for laser tag and mini golf."

#  First Look at Ho-Chunk Casino's Zeus Game

On September 12, 2017, Ho-Chunk Casino in Wisconsin Dells introduced their new slot game: Zeus. The game is a five reel, 20 pay line video slot with a Greek mythology theme.

The demo I played had a minimum bet of $0.01 and a maximum bet of $10.00. There are six bonus features in the game: Wild (Zeus himself), scatter (a thunderbolt), free spins, expanding wilds, stacked wilds, and bonus wheel. I didn't trigger any of the bonuses during my demo, but it was exciting to watch the reels spin and see what kind of combinations landed on the paylines.

One feature I especially liked was the "gamble" button. After any winning combination lands on the paylines, you can choose to gamble your winnings by choosing heads or tails on a coin flip. If you guess correctly, your winnings are doubled; if you guess incorrectly, you lose everything. This adds an extra level of excitement to the game and gives players a chance to either increase their winnings or lose it all in a single flip of the coin.

Overall, I really enjoyed playing Zeus and am looking forward to giving it a try at real money wagers. The graphics are high quality and the gameplay is smooth and engaging. If you're looking for a new slot game to play, be sure to check out Ho-Chunk Casino's Zeus!
