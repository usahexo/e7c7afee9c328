#  Kentucky lawmakers to take up sports betting in 2019

Kentucky lawmakers announced this week that they will take up legislation to legalize sports betting in the state during the 2019 legislative session.

House Speaker David Osborne and Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer said that they plan to move forward with a bill that would allow licensed casinos and racetracks in Kentucky to offer sports betting.

“This is something that we need to do,” Osborne said. “It is an opportunity for us to bring some new revenue into the state and create some new jobs.”

The proposal would legalize both in-person and online sports betting in the state, and would allow bets on all professional and college sports. It would also establish a regulatory framework for sports betting, including licensing requirements and fees.

There is no word yet on what the proposed legislation might look like, but it is likely that it will face opposition from some lawmakers who are concerned about the potential for gambling addiction.

“We have to be very careful as we go forward with this, because there are obviously dangers associated with it,” Thayer said.

At least 10 states have already legalized sports betting since the 2018 Supreme Court decision struck down a federal ban on the practice. Kentucky could join those states if the proposed legislation is approved by the legislature next year.

#  Bucs hope Kentucky approves sports betting soon

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers hope that the Kentucky state government approves sports betting soon as they believe it will increase tourism and help to generate more revenue for the state.

“We’re supportive of it, obviously, because it creates another opportunity to bring people to Florida and drive economic impact here in our state,” said Brian Ford, the Bucs’ chief operating officer.

Ford believes that if Kentucky does not approve sports betting, then neighboring states such as Georgia and Tennessee will do so and will take away some of the business from Florida.

Governor Matt Bevin is in support of legalizing sports betting and believes that it would be a major boost for the state’s economy. The bill has already been passed by the Senate and is now awaiting approval from the House.

The NFL has long been opposed to legalized sports betting, but that stance appears to be changing. In a recent interview, commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league was open to discussing the possibility of allowing its teams to partner with casinos on sports betting.

If Kentucky does legalize sports betting, it is likely that the Buccaneers will be one of the first teams to partner with a casino.

#  How close is Kentucky to legalizing sports betting?

Since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting in May, Kentucky has been one of a handful of states considering legalizing it.

Democratic state Rep. Jason Nemes sponsored House Bill 177, which would legalize sports betting in Kentucky. The House Judiciary Committee voted 8-5 to approve the bill on Wednesday (July 25). The proposed bill would allow people 21 and older to bet on professional, collegiate, and international sporting events at licensed casinos and racetracks in Kentucky. It would also give the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission the authority to regulate sports betting.

Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has said he is open to legalizing sports betting in Kentucky, but he wants to make sure that any regulatory framework protects consumers and prevents any form of cheating or corruption.

It remains unclear whether or not HB 177 will pass the full House and Senate, but there is certainly momentum behind it. If it does become law, Kentucky would join Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi as states that have legalized sports betting since the SCOTUS decision.

#  What are the chances of Kentucky legalizing sports betting?

On November 6, 2018, the people of Kentucky voted on a constitutional amendment that would legalize sports betting in the state. The amendment passed by a wide margin, but it still needs to be signed into law by the governor.

Governor Matt Bevin has not taken a public stance on the issue, but there is speculation that he will veto the bill. If that happens, lawmakers will need to override the veto in order for sports betting to become legal in Kentucky.

This is not the first time that Kentucky has considered legalizing sports betting. A similar measure was introduced in 2017, but it did not receive enough votes to pass.

So what are the chances of Kentucky legalizing sports betting?

It's hard to say, but things are looking good for supporters of the amendment. The vote was overwhelming, and lawmakers have said that they will push ahead with efforts to override the veto if necessary.

If you're interested in betting on sports, then you should keep an eye on developments in Kentucky. It's possible that legal sports betting could be up and running in the state before the end of 2019.

#  Sports gambling could be headed to Kentucky soon

After a long wait, it appears that sports gambling could be coming to Kentucky. This is great news for fans of the sport, who can now place bets on their favorite teams and players. There are still some details that need to be worked out, but it looks like sports gambling could be coming to Kentucky in the very near future.

This is good news for the state as a whole, as it will bring in additional revenue that can be used for various purposes. It will also create new jobs, which is always a good thing. In addition, it will help to keep people engaged with sports, which is always a positive thing.

There are some concerns that need to be addressed before sports gambling can be legalized in Kentucky. One of the biggest concerns is the impact that this will have on the integrity of the sport. It is important to make sure that sports gambling does not ruin the integrity of sporting events.
