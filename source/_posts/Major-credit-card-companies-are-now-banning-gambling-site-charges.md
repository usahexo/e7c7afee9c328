#  Major credit card companies are now banning gambling site charges

In the past, major credit card companies allowed their customers to use their cards to deposit and withdraw money from gambling websites. However, in recent months they have all started banning these transactions.

In a notice to its customers, Visa said that it is "committed to protecting the integrity of the payment system and liability for illegal activities falls on the party initiating the transaction." Mastercard made a similar announcement, saying that it wants to "protect our customers from fraudulent and illegal activity."

This move comes as a big blow to gambling websites, which have been struggling in recent years due to increasing regulation. In 2017, the UK Gambling Commission issued new rules requiring operators to verify the age and identity of their customers. And in 2018, the US Department of Justice indicted three of the largest offshore gambling companies for money laundering offences.

The credit card companies' ban will make it even harder for these companies to operate. Customers will now have to find alternative methods of depositing and withdrawing money, such as using cryptocurrencies or online payment platforms like PayPal.

#  Woman gets $5,000 refund after disputing gambling site charge

A woman in the United States was refunded $5,000 after she disputed a charge from a gambling site. The woman, who has not been named, claimed that she had not made the bet that led to the charge.

The charge was for $4,999.99 and it had been made in February of this year. After disputing the charge, the woman received a full refund from the gambling site. This is just one example of how consumer protection laws can help people who have been wronged by businesses.

In addition to disputing the charge, the woman also contacted her credit card company to make sure that the charge was not added to her credit card bill. This is another step that people can take to protect themselves from being charged for something they did not authorized.

It is important to note that not all gambling sites are created equal. Some sites are known for being more reputable than others, so it is important to do your research before choosing one. Also, be sure to read the terms and conditions of any site before you sign up so that you know what you’re getting into.

If you have been wronged by a gambling site or any other business, it is important to speak up and fight for your rights. There are consumer protection laws in place that can help you get your money back or hold the business responsible for their actions. Contact an attorney if you need help getting started with your case.

#  Credit card company charges customer for disputed gambling site charge

A customer of a credit card company was recently charged for a disputed charge to a gambling site. The customer had filed a dispute with the site after not receiving the payout they were promised. The credit card company, in response, charged the customer for the disputed amount as well as a $35 dispute fee.

The customer contacted the credit card company to ask why they were being charged for the disputed amount. The representative informed them that it was standard procedure to charge the customer in cases such as these. The customer argued that they should not be penalized for trying to get their money back, but the representative insisted that there was nothing they could do.

This incident is yet another example of how credit card companies can take advantage of customers. By charging them for disputed amounts, Card companies can essentially force customers to pay for something they may not even owe. This can be especially frustrating for customers who have already had to go through the hassle of filing a dispute.

If you find yourself in a situation like this, it is important to stand up for yourself and fight back against these unfair charges. Talk to a representative from the credit card company and let them know that you disagree with being charged for a disputed amount. If they refuse to listen, consider taking legal action.

#  Gambling site winnings seized after credit card dispute

A gambling site that let users deposit funds and withdraw winnings using their credit cards is in trouble after a customer disputed a payment.

The site, which is not being named to avoid any further legal issues, allowed users to gamble and then withdraw their winnings directly to their credit card.

However, one customer decided to dispute a €200 payment, arguing that the money should have been refunded to them as they had not actually won anything.

As the site doesn't have any formal agreements with banks or credit card companies, the entire site's funds were seized by the payment processor until the dispute could be resolved.

This leaves the site with no way to pay its players, who may well have lost money in the process.

It's not clear how long it will take for the dispute to be resolved, but in the meantime, the site's owners are left wondering what to do next.

#  Man gets charged $500 for disputing a $5 charge to a gambling site

A man in the UK recently found himself charged £340 (roughly $500) for disputing a £5 charge to his online gambling account. The man, who has not been identified, contacted his bank after noticing the extra charge on his statement.

According to the bank, the £5 charge was for "third-party services", which is apparently a euphemism for gambling websites. When the man disputed the charge, his bank responded by hitting him with a £340 fee for doing so.

Understandably outraged, the man took to social media to share his story and warn others about the potential dangers of disputed charges. In a now-deleted post, he wrote: "If you ever get asked to pay for 'third-party services' on your bank statement, always dispute it! I just got charged £340 by my bank for disputing a £5 charge from a gambling site."

The incident has served as a wake-up call for many people, who are now warning others about the dangers of disputed charges. Gambling addiction can be incredibly dangerous, and can quickly spiral out of control if not treated properly.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. There are many resources available to those who need it, including counseling and therapy programs. You are not alone, and there is hope for recovery.
