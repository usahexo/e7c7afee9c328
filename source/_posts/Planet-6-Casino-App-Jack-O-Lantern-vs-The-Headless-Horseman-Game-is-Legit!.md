 Halloween is just around the corner and everyone is getting into the spooky spirit. Planet 6 Casino has certainly got into the groove with their new game, Jack O Lantern vs The Headless Horseman. So, which one is better: the pumpkin or the ghost?

The graphics in this game are absolutely stunning. You can really feel the atmosphere of Halloween as you play. The characters are all well designed and fit perfectly into the theme. The pumpkin is definitely cute and friendly, while the headless horseman is downright scary!

In terms of gameplay, both characters have their own unique abilities. The pumpkin can shoot fireballs at enemies, while the headless horseman can use his sword to slash them. There are also power-ups available to help you out along the way. For example, the power-up that turns you into a giant pumpkin is especially helpful for taking out a lot of enemies at once.

So, which one is better? In my opinion, they’re both great in their own ways. If you’re looking for an intense action game, then go for the headless horseman. But if you want something a bit cuter and more casual, then go for Jack O Lantern. Either way, you’re sure to have a blast playing this Halloween-themed game!
