#  Liverpool crowned Premier League champions for first time in 29 years

Liverpool completed one of the most astonishing comebacks in the history of English football to be crowned Premier League champions for the first time in 29 years.

Trailing by three points to Manchester City with just two games remaining, Liverpool’s players and supporters never lost faith that they could overturn the deficit and complete an incredible title triumph.

First up was a home clash against Newcastle, with a Reds win guaranteeing them the title. Goals from Mohammad Salah and Sadio Mane either side of half-time put Liverpool in control, before Divock Origi’s late strike made sure of the victory.

Next up was a trip to face defending champions City at the Etihad Stadium. A win or a draw for Liverpool would see them crowned champions, while anything less would mean they would have to rely on Manchester United dropping points to Crystal Palace.

What followed was one of the most nerve-wracking 90 minutes in Premier League history, as Liverpool held on for a 0-0 draw to finish one point clear of Pep Guardiola’s side and be crowned champions for the first time since 1990.

Jurgen Klopp’s side have surpassed all expectations this season, having struggled badly in Philippe Coutinho’s absence at the start of the campaign. The arrival of Virgil van Dijk in January has transformed their defence, while Salah, Mane and Roberto Firmino have once again terrorised opposition defences.

#  Manchester City miss out on Premier League title by one point

Manchester City’s quest for the Premier League title ended in heartbreak on Sunday as they were pipped to the post by Liverpool by a single point.

The Citizens had led the table for most of the season, but a stunning late-season run from Liverpool saw them overhaul Pep Guardiola’s side at the top of the table.

It was a bitterly disappointing end to the season for Manchester City, who will now be left to reflect on what might have been.

Liverpool’s 97 points is the third-highest total in Premier League history, and they can now rightly claim to be one of the greatest sides in English top-flight history.

For Manchester City, meanwhile, it is yet another frustrating near-miss in their pursuit of major silverware.

Pep Guardiola will no doubt be determined to go one better next season and finally get his hands on some much-needed Premier League glory.

#  Man Utd suffer worst Premier League finish since 1990

Manchester United have finished in sixth place in the Premier League, their worst league finish since 1990.

United started the season brightly, but they went on to suffer a series of poor results which led to them missing out on Champions League qualification.

They will now have to play in the Europa League next season, and they will be hoping to win it in order to qualify for the Champions League.

Manager Louis van Gaal has come under criticism for United's performances this season, and he is likely to face the sack at the end of the campaign.

United captain Wayne Rooney has admitted that his team have let themselves down this season, and he is determined to make amends next year.

#  Chelsea secure Champions League qualification with third-place finish

Chelsea secured Champions League qualification with a third-place finish in the Premier League and will join London rivals Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in Europe’s premier competition next season.

The Blues were held to a goalless draw by Huddersfield at Stamford Bridge on the final day of the season, but it mattered little as fourth-placed Arsenal lost 3-1 to Leicester.

It was an underwhelming campaign for Chelsea, who finished behind title winners Manchester City and runners-up Liverpool. Maurizio Sarri’s side did manage to win the Europa League, but they will be looking to make a bigger impact in the Champions League next season.

Eden Hazard has been linked with a move away from Chelsea this summer, but the Belgian playmaker has insisted he is happy at Stamford Bridge.

Hazard was voted as Chelsea’s player of the year for a fifth time after scoring 16 goals and providing 14 assists in all competitions.

N’Golo Kante, David Luiz and Olivier Giroud have also been linked with moves away from Chelsea this summer, but it remains to be seen if Sarri will keep faith with the bulk of his title-winning squad next season.

#  Arsenal seal Europa League spot with win over Burnley

Arsenal have sealed their place in next season's Europa League after a comfortable win over Burnley at the Emirates Stadium.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang got the scoring underway early on, converting from the spot after he was brought down in the area by Ben Mee.

The Gunners doubled their lead before the break, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan curling home a superb free-kick from 25 yards.

Aubameyang then made it 3-0 shortly after half-time, finishing off a flowing team move.

Arsenal continued to dominate and should have added to their tally, but were ultimately happy to take all three points and book their place in next season's Europa League.
