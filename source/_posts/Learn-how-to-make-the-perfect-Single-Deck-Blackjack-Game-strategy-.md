#  Learn how to make the perfect Single Deck Blackjack Game strategy 

This guide will teach you how to make the perfect Single Deck Blackjack Game strategy.

There are a few things you need to know about Blackjack before getting started. The first is that there are different types of Blackjack games. The most common type is the Classic or Las Vegas Strip game, which uses six decks of cards. Other variants include Atlantic City and Double Deck, which both use two decks of cards, and Spanish 21, which uses eight decks of cards.

The second thing you need to know is Blackjack basic strategy. This is a mathematically-proven way to play each hand that gives you the best chance possible of winning. You can find basic strategy charts for all types of Blackjack games online.

Once you understand the basics, it’s time to start learning how to make the perfect Single Deck game strategy. There are a few important things to keep in mind:

1) In a single deck game, the dealer has an advantage over the player. This is because there is only one deck in play, so the dealer can draw more favorable cards than the player can.

2) The size of the dealer’s advantage varies depending on the rules of the game. In some games, the dealer must hit on any card total of 16 or less, while in others they must stand on all 17s. This means that in some games, the dealer’s advantage is smaller than in others.

3) Because of the dealer’s advantage, your goal in a single deck game should be to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (known as busting). This means that you should avoid taking hits when your card total is high, and instead wait for a better opportunity to take a hit.

4) Another important thing to keep in mind is that insurance bets are not recommended in single deck games. Insurance bets are paid out at 2-1 if the player’s blackjack beats the dealer’s blackjack, but they are only profitable if the player has a probability of greater than 50% of winning. Since the dealer has an edge in single deck games, insurance bets are not recommended because they have negative expected value (-EV).

#  How to win at Single Deck Blackjack every time 
There are a couple of things that you can do to help increase your chances of winning when playing single deck blackjack. 

The first thing is to familiarize yourself with the basic blackjack strategy. This will help you to make the best decisions possible based on the cards that are currently in play. 

Another thing that you can do is to always split aces and eights. Splitting aces will give you two separate chances to draw a card that will give you 21, and splitting eights will give you two chances to draw a card that is worth 10 points. 

You should also double down if you have a hand of 11 points or if you have a hand of 10 points and the dealer has a card worth 4, 5, or 6 points. This will give you the chance to get more money on the table while still having a good chance of winning. 

By following these tips, you can increase your chances of winning at single deck blackjack every time!
