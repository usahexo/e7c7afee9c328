#  In Las Vegas Sports Betting on Panathinaikos
In Las Vegas sports betting, there are plenty of opportunities to wager on your favorite team. Of course, in the NFL and NBA, the most popular bets are on which team will win the game outright. However, in other sports leagues such as the European soccer leagues, there are a variety of different bets that can be made.
In soccer, one popular bet is on what team will win the first half of the game. In the Panathinaikos vs PAOK match taking place in Greece on Sept. 12, 2018, Panathinaikos was a slight favorite to win the first half of the game. 

The odds for this bet are usually displayed as either a positive or negative number followed by a "To Win" indication. So, for example, -120 would indicate that you would need to wager $120 to win $100 if your selection wins the first half of the game. On the flip side, +100 would mean that a winning $100 bet would pay out $200. 

Panathinaikos went into halftime with a 1-0 lead and ended up winning 2-0. So if you had placed a $100 bet on them to win the first half of the game, you would have won $200!

#  What Does Virginia Mean for Panathinaikos?

After the shocking departure of manager Marinos Ouzounidis, many were wondering who would be the next man to take the helm of Panathinaikos. Many names were tossed about, but the one that caught everyone’s attention was current Aston Villa manager and former Panathinaikos midfielder, Steve Bruce. Bruce has a wealth of experience in English football, but this will be his first managerial job in Greece.

There is no question that Bruce is a talented manager, but there are some who are questioning whether or not he is the right man for the job at Panathinaikos. The biggest challenge that Bruce will face is getting the team to play consistent football. The club has been plagued by inconsistency in recent years, which has resulted in them being unable to defend their title.

Another challenge that Bruce will face is dealing with the intense media scrutiny that comes with managing a team like Panathinaikos. The fans are incredibly passionate and they expect their team to always win. If Bruce fails to lead Panathinaikos to success, he will likely be vilified by the fans and the media.

That said, there is no doubt that Bruce is a capable manager and he has what it takes to lead Panathinaikos back to the top of Greek football. He has already started impressing the fans by making some big signings, such as Marko Livaja and Steven Fletcher. These signings should help improve Panathinaikos’ chances of winning silverware this season.

While it remains to be seen how successful Bruce will be at Panathinaikos, there is no doubt that he brings plenty of experience and knowledge to the table. This could be just what Panathinaikos needs to finally return to the top of Greek football

#  Panathinaikos Faces Tough Test in Vegas

The Panathinaikos basketball club is in Las Vegas for the European preseason tournament and will face some tough challenges.

On Thursday, they'll play against Spanish powerhouse FC Barcelona, and on Saturday they'll square off against the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors.

Both games should be great tests for the Greens, who are coming off a disappointing season in which they failed to make it past the group stage of the Euroleague playoffs.

They'll be looking to rebound this season with a new head coach, former assistant Ioannis Sfairopoulos.

Sfairopoulos has already made an impact on the team, instituting a more aggressive defensive style that should help them compete against Europe's best clubs.

Of course, it won't be easy to win in Vegas, as both Barcelona and Golden State are stacked with top talent.

But Panathinaikos will be looking to make a statement in their first two games and start the season off on the right foot.

#  Odds Shift in Panathinaikos' Favor

Euroleague
Round 18
19 December 2017

For the first time in this season’s Euroleague, Panathinaikos has better odds to win than their opponents. Olympiakos was the favorite heading into tonight’s matchup, but PAN has now taken over as slight favorites with odds of -115 to win, compared to Olympiakos at -105.

After a series of losses, Olympiakos may be feeling some pressure as they enter tonight’s game. They have fallen from first to fourth in the standings and are currently on a two-game losing streak. PAN, on the other hand, is coming off two straight wins and is looking to continue their streak.

This game is definitely going to be an exciting one!

#  Can Panathinaikos Bounce Back in Vegas?

The 2019 Las Vegas Summer League will feature 24 NBA teams, including reigning champs the Toronto Raptors. The schedule is set with games from July 5-15 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.

While it’s only summer league and doesn’t have the same prestige as the regular season or playoffs, teams and players use it as an opportunity to gel, work on new plays and put their best foot forward.

This summer, Panathinaikos will be one of those 24 teams in Vegas. The Greens come into the tournament following a demoralizing first-round exit from the EuroLeague playoffs against FC Bayern Munich. That was their sixth consecutive appearance in the postseason, but they were unceremoniously bounced in the opening round for the third time in six years.

Panathinaikos looked out of sync against Bayern, shooting just 39 percent from the field and 29 percent from three-point range. They’ll need to be much better in Vegas if they want to rebound from that disappointing end to their season.
