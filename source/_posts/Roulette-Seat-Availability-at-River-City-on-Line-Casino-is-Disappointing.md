#  Roulette Seat Availability at River City on Line Casino is Disappointing

A recent check of seat availability at River City Casino found that the roulette tables had very few open seats. The blackjack and craps tables appeared to have more seats available. 

The disappointing seat availability comes at a time when River City Casino is touting its expansion project, which is expected to be completed in 2019. Part of the expansion project includes doubling the number of gaming tables, from 140 to 280. The project will also include a new high-limit gaming area and a luxury hotel with 300 guest rooms.

The lack of seat availability could be due to the fact that the casino is only open on weekdays from 9am to 3am, and on weekends from 10am to 3am. The casino is also closed on some major holidays, including Christmas Day and Easter Sunday. 

Another possible reason for the lack of seating is that River City Casino is located in Missouri, which has a population of just over 6 million people. That's compared to Nevada, which has a population of nearly 3 million people and offers dozens of casinos. 

There are also larger casinos located in nearby states, such as Illinois (Casino Queen) and Kansas (Hollywood Casino). These casinos offer more gaming options, including table games like roulette, as well as slot machines and other forms of gambling. 

Despite the lack of seating availability, River City Casino appears to be doing well financially. In Fiscal Year 2018, the casino generated over $235 million in revenue.
