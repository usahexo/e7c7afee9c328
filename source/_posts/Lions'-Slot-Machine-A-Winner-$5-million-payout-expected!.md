#  Lions' Slot Machine A Winner: $5 million payout expected!

The casino in Detroit is awash with speculation that a slot machine created by gambler and Michigan native John Heywood is going to pay out big. The so-called Lions’ Slot Machine is purportedly based on the four losing seasons of the Detroit Lions football team, and is reputed to pay out $5 million dollars when it hits.

The Lions’ Slot Machine first made the news in 2012 when it was installed at the MGM Grand Casino in Detroit. The buzz around the machine increased in 2014 when anonymous sources claimed that the machine would pay out $5 million on May 1st of that year. When that date passed without incident, the talk around the machine grew even more intense, with some people claiming that it had been “hot-wired” to payout on May 1st of every year.

This May 1st, 2017, will mark the fourth consecutive year that speculation about the Lions’ Slot Machine has reached a fever pitch. And while many gamblers are eager to try their luck at hitting the big payout, others are more cautious. Jerry, a regular at one of Detroit’s casinos, says “I might give it a try if I can find someone to loan me some money. But I’m not betting my house on it!”

So far, there has been no confirmation as to whether or not the Lions’ Slot Machine will payout this year. But with so much money on the line, there is little doubt that people will be flocking to Detroit casinos in droves to try their luck!

#  Lions Slot Fans Walk Away with $10,000 Each!

Detroit Lions slot receiver Golden Tate announced on social media that all of the fans at Ford Field for the team’s Week 3 game against the New England Patriots would be receiving a $10,000 prize.

The idea came to Tate after he caught the game-winning touchdown in the fourth quarter.

“It was just in the moment,” Tate said after the game. “I was like, ‘Hey, we won. Let me go talk to Coach (Matt Patricia) and see if we can do something for the fans.’ And coach was all for it.”

Lions officials told ESPN that they would be giving away 125 prizes of $10,000 each to Lions fans in attendance. The money will be paid out through a random drawing of ticket holders who were at the game.

Tate later took to Twitter to announce the news, and Lions fans went wild! Some even compared it to the team’s 2006 Thanksgiving Day game against the Dallas Cowboys when then-coach Rod Marinelli gave each fan a turkey.

Some Lions faithful took to social media to share their thoughts on the giveaway.

“This is amazing! Detroit sports are finally doing something right,” one fan wrote on Twitter.

Another added: “What an amazing gesture by Tate and Patricia! I love this team! #OnePride.”

#  Tenth Time's the Charm for Detroit Slot Machine Winners

DETROIT, MI - Detroit residents hit the jackpot for the tenth time this year when two slot machine players walked away with a combined $90,000 in winnings.

For Marie Banks and Curtis Pinkney, it was their lucky day as they each won $45,000 at MotorCity Casino.

"I just can't believe it," said Banks. "I've been playing these machines for years and I've never won anything close to this amount."

"It's surreal," added Pinkney. "I still can't believe that I actually hit the jackpot."

The winnings are just the latest in a series of big payouts for Detroiters at local casinos. In February, four people won over $200,000 at MGM Grand Detroit Casino. And in January, three people took home over $100,000 from Greektown Casino-Hotel.

So what's the secret to Detroit's slot machine success? According to casino officials, it's a combination of luck and strategy.

"People need to be patient and take their time," said Vanessa Allen-Wright of MotorCity Casino. "And they need to make sure they're playing the right machines."

Detroit may have struck gold with its slot machines, but that doesn't mean every casino is a winner. Earlier this year, Maryland Live! Casino announced it would lay off 400 employees after posting its first ever quarterly loss. The blame? Slowing revenue from table games and slots.
